# Advent of Code

My shot at the advent of code challenges:
https://adventofcode.com

## Running the solutions
Run `bun solve`, then proceed to pick the year and day.
Alternatively, you can pass the year and/or day directly as params, eg:
`bun solve 2022` or `bun solve 2020 13`.

Optionally, you can also pass in a third param,
specifying which part of the challenge (1 or 2) to run, eg:
`bun solve 2024 12 1`

## Supporting script
* TypeScript compiler: `bun tsc`
* ESLint: `bun eslint`
* Tests: `bun test`
